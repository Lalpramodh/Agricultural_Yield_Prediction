      <h1>Agriculture Yield Prediction</h1>
      <p style="color: black;">
        Welcome to our website! We hope you are doing well with your farm. We are here to provide suggestions about your crop cultivation.
        We recommend which crop you should grow in your farm for better yields. It's very easy to predict which crop to grow based on your soil nutrients.
        You just need to know your soil nutrients, which you can test in a lab.
